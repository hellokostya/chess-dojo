/*
 * How a puzzle attempt is scored, and how that moves a member's tactics rating.
 *
 * Score for a puzzle = accuracy x speed, a number from 0 to 1. It is used like a game result in
 * an Elo rating: a member is expected to score a certain amount against a puzzle of a given
 * rating, and their rating moves by how far they land above or below that.
 *
 * Puzzle ratings are fitted, offline, on this same score, so a member at a puzzle's rating
 * averages 0.5 on it. The time penalty is part of that fit, which is why it cannot inflate
 * ratings. Nothing here is a bonus: the score never goes above 1.
